# Ubuntu (and its derivatives)

## Style

Install Tweaks to change your UI theme and use Gnome extensions (see below):
`sudo apt install gnome-tweaks`

Install gnome extensions at [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/). To customize your taskbar I recommend [Dash-to-panel](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1160/dash-to-panel/).

To learn how to the change the color scheme of your terminal, visit Gogh. Note, if you receive an environment error while installing you may be able to fix it by following this thread. Also note, the terminal you're using must be the Gnome Terminal (which is the default for Ubuntu) or [one of these](https://github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh#color-scheme-for-your-terminal).
