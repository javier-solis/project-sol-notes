# Project Sol | Notes

This repository holds the Markdown files that are used to generate the webpages served to a user,
currently hosted at [notes.projectsol.net](https://notes.projectsol.net).

As of November 2023, the webpages are generated using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and
[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). To render this site locally,
run `mkdocs serve` under the `/docs` folder (after the dependencies are installed).

## Dependencies
1. Install [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/#)
2. Install additional dependencies by running `pip install requirements.txt`
