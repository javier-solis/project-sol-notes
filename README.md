# Project Sol - Notes

This repository holds the Markdown files that are used to generate the webpages served to a user,
currently hosted at [notes.projectsol.net](https://notes.projectsol.net).

As of November 2023, the webpages are generated using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and
[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

To render this site locally, ensure dependencies are installed. Then, you can do 1 of 2 things:
2. Run `mkdocs build` and open `site/index.html`.
3. Run `mkdocs serve` and visit `http://localhost:9000/`.

## Dependencies
1. Install [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/#)
2. Install additional dependencies by running `pip install requirements.txt`
